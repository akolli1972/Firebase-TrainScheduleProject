# Firebase-TrainScheduleProject
 I created a train schedule application that would incorporate Firebase to host train arrival and departure data. The app would have to retrieve and manipulate that information using Moment.js. The website should also provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
